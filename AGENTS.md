AI Instructions
- Architecture: Strictly single-file HTML. No separate .js or .css files.
- Dependencies: Use CDNs only (Tailwind, Chart.js, etc.).
- Tone: Technical but "vibe-oriented." Prioritize elegant UI and mobile responsiveness.
- Context: The user is a Google SWE; assume high technical literacy but low patience for boilerplate.
- Coding Conventions & Engineering Standards
- Style: Follow Google JavaScript Style Guide (naming conventions, documentation).
- Typing: Since this is a single .html file, use JSDoc for type definitions. This allows VS Code (or github.dev) to provide TypeScript-like intellisense and type checking without a compilation step.
- Modern JS: Use ES Modules, Optional Chaining (?.), Nullish Coalescing (??), and async/await. Avoid legacy patterns or var.
- State Management: Use a simple reactive "Store" pattern (e.g., a proxy-based state object) rather than messy DOM manipulation.
- Unit Testing: npm test operating on code extracted from the index.html.
- Privacy: All data processing (Green Button XML/CSV) must happen locally in the browser. No data should ever be sent to a server.
