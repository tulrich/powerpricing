# powerpricing

An app for estimating electricity bills under different rate plans and usage patterns.

The initial version is based on my local utility, ConEd in New York city, which offers a traditional volumetric rate plan (you pay for the total kwh used in a month) and also a newer Select Pricing Plan that takes into account the peak power usage during the month and has different usage rates for different times of day. Select Pricing is quite complicated but designed to better reflect the actual costs of running the system and incentivize more efficient behaviors and choices. For heat pump users, it can significantly reduce bills! But its tricky to estimate ahead of time, so I vibe coded this app to help.
